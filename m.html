    <p>hi! are you a mapper who wants to make maps for the 100 player server? that's great we'd love to have more maps.</p>
    <p>these are my stipulations/requirements:</p>
    <li>symmetrical modes always stalemate immediately and has proven through multiple maps and attempts by many people to be basically impossible to make fun. please stick to payload or A/D</li>
    <li>this should be a map that you created - this is not a "try this map" queue, this is a form for people who actually want to make maps that make sense for 100 players to get playtesting and feedback. i already wasted 2 days of streaming trying workshop maps people sent me before. this doesn't work and doesn't go well.</li>
    <li>please stop buying into the misconception that your map now needs to be extremely big. we have tried conquest hydro and many other massive maps, it doesn't work and it's not fun. my advice is to approach it like any other 24 player map in terms of scaling and distances and etc. the one difference is to just be more keenly aware of providing enough flank/entryways and not to let sentry stacking dominate too hard.</li>
