    <p>the player "Hardened Zver" has been permanently banned from shounic trenches.</p>
    <p>this choice may come as a surprise to the community, so this document is being created. please read through the entire document and please share any information disclosed here shoud you spot any misrepresentations or falsehoods regarding the nature of the ban. thank you</p>
    <p></p>
    <p></p>
    <p>there are several factors that have culminated into this ban, and below is an enumeration of them in no particular order. none of the following reasons are the entire justification for the ban, and the totality of the situation needs to be considered.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p></p>
    <p>## factor 1: inexplicable player behaviors</p>
    <p>background context: on November 20th, "Hardened Zver" was warned for his behavior in attempting to subvert the server's systems at attempting to create balanced matches. Zver would frequently take advantage of situations where his team had more players than the other team to swap over, such that he would be able to play on the same team as individuals he believed to also be adept. within the context of this document, this is "team stacking".</p>
    <p>the warning given was for him to stop attempting to abuse this in any capacity, or face a permanent ban from the server. (though this is not the crime he is being punished for today)</p>
    <p>in addition to the warning given out, a plugin was developed specifically because of this player's abuse of the system, to block any players from using the team menu to swap teams during the game.</p>
    <p>with this explicit denouncement of team swapping as evidence with the introduction of this plugin, players who were spotted attempting to circumvent this by disconnecting then rejoining the server, usually through the console command "retry", were given warnings and made aware that further abuse would lead to permanent bans.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p></p>
    <p>problem at hand: players, usually those that primarily play medic, who are sympathetic and interested in healing Zver, seemingly directed by Zver, would take advantage of different means to swap their team to Zver's isntead.</p>
    <p>in addition to this, players have been discovered to be creating new steam accounts, or using existing alternate steam accounts to avoid punishment in order to team stack with Zver. our basis for this claim come from comparing IP addresses. there are multiple steam accounts that connect to the server with the same IP address. the use of a VPN is ruled out due to the IP being residential.</p>
